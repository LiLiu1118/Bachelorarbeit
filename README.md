The overall design of the unmanned electric logistics vehicle

In this paper, electric unmanned logistics vehicle is studied. The overall selection and design optimization  is  carried  out  with  Catia,  Caxa,  Python  and  other  software  and  programming languages.  

Firstly,  the  overall  design  scheme  of  the  unmanned  electric  vehicle  is  analyzed according  to  the  design  principles  and  related  regulations  and  standards.  The  performance requirements of the automatic driving, is measured according to the environment sensing system, the decision planning system and the control execution system. 

Then the main technical parameters of the vehicle, including dimensions, quality and performance parameters are determined. 

Finally,  the  structural  types,  characteristicparameters  and  arrangements  of  the  main assemblies of the chassis are determined. Through the vehicle design calculation and analysis, it is ensured that the vehicle has reasonable power, driving range, braking performance, steering stability, driving comfort and passability
